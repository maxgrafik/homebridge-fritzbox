## v0.2.0 (2025-01-29)

- Changed the way how secondary services for smart home devices are added, because sometimes HomeKit doesn't play nice
- Added optional characteristics for lightbulbs (brightness, color temperature, hue/saturation). Don't know if this works as expected. I have no devices to test.
